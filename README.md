Hey Solana #GRIZZLYTHON investors! üêª
Strap in, 'cause we're about to introduce you to Solana College, our rad six-week program that aims to onboard the next 75 devs to Solana. Even in the bear market: the blockchain scene is exploding, and we need more folks from all walks of life jamming with us in the Solana band. Time to close the gap between the big brain builders and the people who've been missing out on the crypto revolution.
Nobody wants to do those dull HTML tutorials that build restaurant menus. We did it and it sucked. Our course is designed for beginners with massive dreams, zero dough, and a burning desire to build their own killer dApp. Solana College makes learning fun by focusing on creating pages that look like DeFi or NFT websites. 
We're cookin' up HTML, CSS, JS, and API‚Äôs in an action packed fifteen-hour course. And did we mention it's FREE? From basic HTML pages reminiscent of degen mint pages from late '21 to using APIs from around the Solana ecosystem to create wicked tools, we cover it all. Our mission is to give students the chops they need to hack mind-blowing tools for the community and themselves, and move on to the Solana docs so they can change the world. 
But that's not all! Were working on weekly guest appearances from Solana devs who'll be ready to answer any burning questions and share their wisdom with students in private AMAs.  We want to empower Solana's diverse community to create ground breaking programs and make this world a whole lot cooler. Students that nail their final project will snag a wicked 'build-or bear' NFT as a shiny resume piece to show off your HTML/CSS/JS/APIs expertise! 
We're all about supporting the community, and we need your help to make this dream come true. With your support, we can spread the word about the contest, compensate the clutch course moderators, and create a prize pool for our hardworking students. 
So let's jam together! Investing in Solana College means giving people the power to transform their lives, learn some rad new skills, and build tools that'll shake up their communities. Join us in making Solana the go-to blockchain for everyone, and let's create an inclusive, diverse, and downright amazing crypto community. Thanks for checking us out, let's rock this thing!
